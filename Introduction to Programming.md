# Introduction to Programming

Q. What is code?

A set of rules or instructions is known as computer code. It's made up of words and numbers that, when arranged correctly, will inform your computer what you want it to perform. Code is written in a certain language's protocol and is used to create programs.

A code can refer to a serial number or a model number when describing a hardware identification number. A code in software might relate to a CD key or an activation code.

Code is a set of rules used in communications and information processing to change information (such as a letter, word, sound, image, or gesture) into another form, sometimes reduced or secret, for transmission across a communication channel or storage in a storage medium. An early example is a linguistic invention that allowed a person to transmit what they thought, saw, heard, or felt to others through speech. However, speech has a limited range of communication due to the distance that a voice may travel and the audience is limited to those present at the time the speech is delivered. Writing, which transformed spoken words into visual symbols, broadened the scope of communication beyond place and time.

Encoding converts data from a source into symbols that may be communicated or stored. Decoding is the process of translating code symbols into a language that the recipient can comprehend, such as English or Spanish.

Q. What is an algorithm?

An algorithm is a set of instructions for solving a problem or performing a computation. Algorithms require that its steps be performed in the correct order.

The word algorithm is taken from the name of Muammad ibn Ms al-Khwrizm, a 9th-century Persian mathematician.

Q. What is a heuristic?

Any technique to problem solving or self-discovery that uses a practical method that is not guaranteed to be optimal, perfect, or rational, but is sufficient for achieving a short-term objective or approximation is referred to as a heuristic. Heuristic approaches can be used to speed up the process of finding a satisfying solution when finding an ideal solution is unattainable or impracticable. Heuristics are mental shortcuts that can help you make a judgment faster.

Trial and error, a rule of thumb, or an educated guess are all examples of heuristics.
